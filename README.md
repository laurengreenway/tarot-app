# React Boilerplate App

Thanks to [this tutorial](https://dev.to/leonardomso/a-complete-react-boilerplate-tutorialfrom-zero-to-hero-jig) for providing a roadmap for this. Changes made were to the testing framework, preferring Mocha/Chai to Jest. Also elected to skip redux to allow more freedom of implementation.

## Scripts

`npm run build` to build the app for production
`npm run dev` to run the app locally
`npm run lint` to format, can add `:fix` for auto formatting
`npm run test` runs the mocha test suite
